# DaisyDriver
The DaisyDriver project aims to make automation a common feature of scientific experiments by providing scientists with a simple, powerful interface to control motors in their setups. The [wiki](https://github.com/fr293/DaisyDriver/wiki/Getting-Started) contains information on how DaisyDrivers are assembled, programmed and operated.
